# Trouve-Ta-Place
This project was completed during my first year as an engineering student at the Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon. 
It involves the creation of a website that allows Lyon drivers to find parking spaces in the urban area and to get there 
based on real-time occupancy data from Lyon's car parks.
