# Trouve-Ta-Place
This project was completed during my first year as an engineering student at the Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon. 
It involves the creation of a website that allows Lyon drivers to find parking spaces in the urban area and to get there 
based on real-time occupancy data from Lyon's car parks.

The website "Find Your Spot" is a site that allows motorists to find the nearest available parking lots to their final destination with available spaces. To achieve this, we have used various APIs: Data Grand Lyon, Google Map - Distance Matrix, Google Map - Maps JavaScript, Google Map - Geocode. Based on our user's destination and the real-time occupancy rate of parking lots, we calculate a score for each parking lot. This metric allows us to rank the parking lots and suggest the most suitable ones for the user's needs.

Additionally, we allow the user to customize their search, especially if they have specific parking constraints. Finally, our site includes a login feature that allows the user to save their search preferences as well as their favorite addresses.
